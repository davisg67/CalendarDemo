# CalendarDemo
A calendar demo using JavaScript and JQuery. Code is well commented. 

Demo has a full year view with all twelve calendars rendered on the page. Each calendar can be clicked to 
show just that calendar in a month view.

Month views have a Last Month and Next Month buttons.

Month view calendar can be clicked on any day to return the full date in an alert.

Should be useful for anyone looking into where to start on their own calendar projects.
